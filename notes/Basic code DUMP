Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.
You have to use the same number of  white spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error.
